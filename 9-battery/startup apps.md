In Debian, you can identify and manage startup applications through several methods:

### 1. **Using `systemd` (for System Services)**

Most system services and applications that start at boot are managed by `systemd`. To list these:

```bash
systemctl list-unit-files --type=service --state=enabled
```

This will show all enabled services that start automatically on boot. You can also view the status of these services with:

```bash
systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running
```


### 4. **Using the Terminal to List Startup Applications**

To get a list of user-level startup applications from the autostart folder, you can run:

```bash
ls ~/.config/autostart/
```

And for system-wide startup applications:

```bash
ls /etc/xdg/autostart/
```

### 5. **Using `rcconf` or `bum` (Optional Packages)**

For additional control over startup services, you can use tools like `rcconf` or `bum` (Boot-Up Manager). These tools provide a simple interface for managing startup services.

To install `rcconf`:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install rcconf
sudo rcconf
```

To install `bum`:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install bum
sudo bum
```

Both `rcconf` and `bum` are primarily for managing services and daemons rather than GUI applications, but they can still be useful for viewing and toggling system-level startup services.
